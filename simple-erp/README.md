## Installation

````Note: make sure you have Docker version 4.30.0 or higher installed.```` 

Run the following command from the project root directory:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

By default, the application's REST API will be available at: http://localhost:8080/erp

Import `openapi.yaml` from the `erp-api` module into your Postman or similar tool.

Enjoy!
